    <section id='sotd'>
Contributions to this document are not only welcomed but are actively solicited
and should be made via
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/openactive/open-booking-api/issues) and
pull requests. The source code is available
on [GitHub](https://github.com/openactive/open-booking-api).

        <div class="note">
This document represents an early Editors Draft of the planned API design. It is
likely to change between now and its final version. These
early drafts are intended to help developers provide that feedback by developing
proof-of-concept implementations. We encourage developers to explore this API and
contribute to the development of the specification.

    <section class="informative">
# Introduction

The document is an output of the
[OpenActive Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/openactive/). As part
of the [OpenActive](https://openactive.io) initiative, the community group is
developing standards that will promote the publication and use of open
[opportunity data](https://openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/#categories-of-physical-activity-data)
in helping people to become more physically active.

The Community Group have already published specifications that define standard
data models ([[!Modelling-Opportunity-Data]]) and support the publication and
harvesting of data in standard formats ([[RPDE]]).

This existing work helps increase the discovery of opportunities for people to
be active. This specification builds on that work by defining an HTTP API that
can be implemented by booking systems that are publishing opportunity data. By
allowing third-party applications to place bookings in their systems, it becomes
 possible for more people to participate in events or make use of leisure and
 sporting facilities.

The specification defines the flow of HTTP requests and responses between the
booking system (server) and the third-party application (client). This includes
definitions of the overall application flow, detailed request and response
formats and the potential error conditions that applications may encounter.

## Scope and requirements

The current scope of the specification should conform to a set of
[use cases and requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fsCr071V12i_2g0DK818OAGlEAJFLWwkBp9bpgx4fo8/edit?usp=sharing)
that have previously been identified and discussed with the OpenActive
community.

The focus of the initial versions of this specification will be on the simplest
use cases that will support making bookings on behalf of users. This core
functionality includes:

* __Pricing and availability__ – checking the price and current availabilty of
an event or for the use of a facility
* __Leasing__ – temporarily reserving spaces for a user to attend an event or
make use of a facility, whilst placing a booking
* __Booking__ – placing and viewing bookings, and where necessary, confirming
receipt of payment from users

A number of additional requirements that relate to the booking of events and
facilities are currently out of scope:

* creating and managing accounts for users
* more complex pricing options, e.g. membership based pricing
* handling bookings for multiple events ("shopping carts") or for groups of users
* waiting lists for events

It is possible that future versions of this specification may include support
for these or other features. Revisions will be driven by the needs of the
community.

### Functionality that is out of scope

By design this specification will not define some types of functionality.

These have been declared as permanently out of scope because they are either
adequately covered by existing specifications, or will be covered by future
work of the OpenActive Community Group.

The functionality that is currrently defined as out of scope includes:

* __API authentication and security__ – while the specification recommends some
best practices relating to authentication and security it does not mandate a
specific means of securing an API. Implementers are free to choose the system
that offers the best security for their platform and users
* __Payment processing__ – the design assumes that all payment handling will
be carried out by the third-party application, in a separate payment flow.
Booking systems and application developers are able to use the payment and
reconciliation mechanisms that provide the best options for their customers
* __API business models__ – the design is agnostic to any business models that
might govern the use of the API, e.g. revenue-sharing or transaction processing
fees
* __Discovery__  – finding, filtering and searching for opportunity data. This
specification assumes that the client and server applications have already
shared data about the relevant opportunities. Additional functionality in this
area will be addressed by future specifications from the Community Group

## Audience

The document is primarily intended for the following audiences:

* Software developers who want to implement the API, e.g. as part of a booking
system
* Software developers building client libraries or applications that will use
the API

The following sections introduce terminology, concepts and requirements that
underpin the design of the API. This content might also be useful for a wider
audience, e.g. business analysts or product managers looking for a high-level
overview of the API functionality.

# Booking Flow

## High-level summary of the API

This API defines a means for a **booking system** to expose an HTTP API that
may be used by a **broker** to place bookings on behalf of a **customer**. By
exposing this API the booking system can support a **seller** in reaching a wider
audience.

A broker provides customers with an application that helps them to discover
opportunities to be physically active. The customer may then choose to make
a booking to attend an **event** or to make use of a **facility**.

The broker will check the availability of event or facility in order to check
whether the customer can still attend. The broker will also present the customer
with information about any costs associated with participating in the event
or using a facility. This involves identifying the applicable **offers** and
presenting them to the user.

If there is still availability and the customer is happy to accept an offer,
then the customer can proceed to make a booking. The broker creates
an **order** on behalf of the user.

Creating the order will also create a temporary **lease** that will reserve a
space for the customer to attend the event (or use the facility) while the
rest of the workflow completes.

If the **offers** for an event or use of a facility indicate that the user must
pay, then the broker will take the customer through a separate **payment**
workflow. This workflow is not defined by this specification.

Once payment has been completed, the broker will update the booking platform to
indicate that payment has been taken. The booking process is then completed.

The completion of the order will result in the lease being removed and a
permanent **reservation** being created on behalf of the customer. The customer
may receive **confirmation** from either the broker or booking system (or both)
that provides details about how and when they can attend the event or use the
booked facility.

Separately the broker and booking system will go through a **reconciliation**
process to transfer funds or otherwise report on successful transactions. A
customer might also cancel an order and will then receive a **refund**. Neither
of these processes are defined by this specification. The details will depend on
the business model and agreements in place between the broker and booking system.

## URLs used in the description of the API

The following sections contain URIs which are for guidance, and are used as
examples only. For example, /events/452 is used to represent the canonical
reference to the web representation of an Event with an id of 452. The URI could
alternatively be /sessions/452 if session is the term used to describe the
specific type of Event in an implementation of this API and associated APIs such
as RDPE in an Open Active compliant **booking system**.

## Step-by-step process description

The 0.5 version of the Booking API supports single items per **order** and
single **payments** per **order**. Future versions of the specification may support
multiple items and multipart **payments**.

### Complete transaction

1. The **broker** requests details on a specific **event** from the **booking
system** (/events/452 in example) in order to discover available **offers**.
These offers are subsequently presented to the **customer**.
2. The **customer** chooses an bookable **offer** (see definition of a bookable
event).
3. If the **offer** for the **event** is bookable, the broker makes a POST
request to the **orders** endpoint (/orders in the examples) containing a
Person object describing the **customer**. At a minimum, this object should
contain the `email` address for the **customer**, if possible the `givenName`
and `familyName`. The **booking system** creates a timed **lease** on the space
in the **event** which is being booked. At this point the **offer** is deemed to
be accepted and an **order** is created. The **booking system** sends a 201
status code, with a representation of the **order** in the body of the response,
and with a Location header set containing the URI for the web representation of
the created **Order** object.
4. If there is a price for the **offer**, the **broker** takes payment from the
**customer** via a third party payment provider.
5. The **broker** notifies the **seller** of the payment by making a PATCH
request to the specific order endpoint (/orders/123 in the example) of the
**booking system**. This should include details of the `paymentMethod` and the
`paymentMethodId` (commonly the last four digits of the card which can be used
by the **seller** to identify the **customer**). The **broker** should store any
details about the transaction which are needed for processing refunds or in the
case of chargebacks. This is out of scope for the Booking API spec and is the
responsibility of the **broker**.
6. The **booking system** notifies the **broker** of a successful order
completion by returning a response with a 200 status code and an object with an
appropriate value for the `confirmationCode` field.

The **broker** is the entity initiating **payment** and as the merchant in the
transaction is responsible for storing records of the **payment** transaction
such as authorization codes. This is an implementation detail and is thus,
out of scope for the Booking API and specification.


### Order cancellation and refund

The **broker** is the party which initiates the third-party **payment**
and is the entity which notifies the **booking system** of **payment** and
creates the **order** on behalf of the **customer**, the **broker** is also the
entity which handles refunds and cancellation.

The workflow to deal with a cancellation and refund of an order is described
below:

1. The **broker** intiates a refund for the **customer** using the mechanisms
provided by the third-party payment provider.

2. The **broker** notifies the **booking system** of the cancellation by making
a patch request to the specific order endpoint (/orders/123 in the example) of
the **booking system**. The PATCH request body should contain an updated
order item in the `orderedItem` property, with the `orderItemStatus` set to
https://schema.org/OrderCancelled to indicate that the ordered item in
the **order** is no longer required.

3. The **booking system** responds to the **broker** with a representation of
the **order** with the `orderStatus` property set to
https://schema.org/OrderCancelled with a status of 200. The **order** is now
deemed to be cancelled.

### Cancelling a Lease

If the **customer** no longer wants to proceed with a particular **offer**, the
lease for the space in the **event** and the **order** may be cancelled by
issuing a DELETE request to the specific order endpoint (/orders/123 in the
example) of the **booking system**.

The **booking system** SHOULD release the
space in the **event** and delete the underlying resource. Any subsequent
requests to this resource should result in a 404 response.

### Handling lease expiry

If the lease has expired during the **payment** process, the **broker** SHOULD
check whether the **event** is still bookable and if the selected **offer** is
still available. If they are, the **broker** should create a new **order** using
the workflow described above.

The **booking system** should respond to requests
for **orders** with an expired lease with a 410 status code with an error
specifying the `errorType` as
https://openactive.io/errors/anonymous_lease_expired until the underlying
**order** resource is removed.

# Common Requirements

This section defines some common functionality that applies to the design of the
whole API.

## Media types


Custom media types are used in this API to allow clients to choose the format
of the data they receive.

Servers MAY choose to support additional media types but MUST support the
media type(s) defined by this specification.

Media types will conform to the following pattern:

```
application/vnd.openactive[.version]+json
```

The current media type is:

```
application/vnd.openactive.0.5+json
```

## Response formats

Requests and response documents exchanged via this API will all be valid
[[!JSON-LD]] documents.

The documents MUST include a [[!JSON-LD]] `context` that refers to the
[[!OpenActive-Vocabulary]] as follows:

<pre class="example" title="minimal JSON-LD document">
{
  "@context": "https://openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld"
}
</pre>

Unless otherwise specified the request and response documents MUST conform to
the [[!Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] data model.

## URL discovery

The Booking API has been defined around the concept of URL discovery. This
allows **booking systems** to create resource URLs which match their own
terms for naming specific objects such as **events** and **orders**.

The URL for a specific action, such as for example providing **payment** details,
may be discovered by parsing the actions defined in the `potentialAction`
property of an object.

An example is below:

<pre class="example" title="Example of a potentialAction">

"potentialAction": [
        {
          "type": "PayAction",
          "name": "Payment",
          "target": {
            "type": "EntryPoint",
            "url": "https://example.com/orders",
            "encodingType": "application/vnd.openactive.v0.5+json",
            "httpMethod": "PATCH"
          }
        }
      ]
</pre>

Since discovery of URLs is an implicit part of the specification, **brokers**
SHOULD avoid hard-coding URLs for specific actions into their applications and
client libraries. **Brokers**  SHOULD use most applicable URL discovered at the
point in the workflow they are currently in - e.g. not use a cached URL that has
been previously successfully used. They should also not attempt to create URLs
for a specific action based on patterns within previously used URLs.

It is the responsibility of **booking platforms** to advertise the URL for
further activity in the booking workflow at the point of need. For example they
MUST advertise the URL for **order** creation when a **broker** requests
a specific **event** resource and SHOULD advertise it in their RDPE feeds since
both of these points within the booking workflow are places where a **customer**
may wish to check availability.


## Error handling

Error responses MUST be served using an appropriate HTTP 4XX status code or HTTP
5XX status code.

All error responses from this API MUST be returned in a JSON-LD format using a
content type of `application/vnd.openactive.v0.5+json` and include at least one
Error object. The error handling has in the Booking API has been modelled
closely on [[!RFC7807]].

<pre class="example" title="Error response format">
            {
              "@context": "https://openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
              "type": "Error",
              "errorType": "https://openactive.io/errors/incomplete_customer_details",
              "title": "Incomplete customer details",
              "details": "No customer details supplied",
              "status": "400",
              "instance": "/orders",
              "method": "POST"
            }
</pre>

* `errorType` – a URI reference [[!RFC3986]] that identifies the problem type. This
specification encourages that, when dereferenced, it provide human-readable
documentation for the problem type.
When this member is not present, its value is assumed to be "about:blank".
* `title` – a short, human-readable summary of the problem type. It
SHOULD NOT change from occurrence to occurrence of the problem, except for
purposes of localization.
* `status`  – the HTTP status code ([[!RFC7231]], Section 6) generated by the
origin server for this occurrence of the problem.
* `instance`  – a URI reference that identifies the specific occurrence of
the problem. It may or may not yield further information if dereferenced.
* `requestId`  – used by technical support for diagnostics purposes.

## Security

All HTTP requests and responses SHOULD be secured using SSL.

## Authentication

All of the API transactions described in this document SHOULD require
authentication.

This standard does not mandate a particular authentication method, but
recommendation is that implementers SHOULD consider using [[OAuth2]] as it is
well-defined, widely supported and can be used in a variety of different
application flows (e.g. via a Javascript web application or between servers).

Where necessary, OpenID Connect ([[OpenIdConnect]]) provides a standard
way of verifying the identity of customer. It is a thin layer that sits
atop OAuth2.

One principle relating to authentication and the Booking API is that **orders**
created by a specific **broker** SHOULD NOT be able to be changed by any other
**broker**. It is the responsibility of the **booking system** to ensure that
subsequent requests to an **order** should only be initiated by the **broker**
which created the **order**.

    </section>

    <section class="normative">
# Operations

## Checking availability and offers

This specification assumes that a *broker* has already obtained opportunity
data from a *booking system* that includes descriptions of events, facilities,
etc. For example by harvesting data via an [[RPDE]] feed.

The availability of an event or facility may change at any time.

The offers available to a customer might also change over time.

A booking system that MUST allow a broker to check the current state of events
and/or facilities depending on what decide they expose from their platform.

### Definition of 'bookable'

An **event** is deemed to be 'bookable' if:

- The **event** has not already occurred, i.e. the `endDate` of the **event**
has not been exceeded

- The `eventStatus` of the **event** does not indicate that it has been
cancelled or postponed

- The `remainingAttendeeCapacity` of the **event** is greater than the number
of places required

- The `potentialAction` of the **event** contains one or more appropriate
ReserveAction objects

- There are one or more valid bookable **offers** for the **event**

- The temporary lease on the space in the **event** (defined in
`orderLeaseDuration`) has not expired before the **payment** is taken
by the **broker** and the **seller** is notified by the **broker** that payment
has taken place.

The **customer** may be ineligible to attend a 'bookable' **event**, but may
book a space for someone else (e.g. a child) if:

- The gender of the **customer** taking up the opportunity is incompatible with
the `genderRestriction` of the **event** but the attendee is compatible

- The age of the **customer** taking up the opportunity is incompatible with the
`ageRange` of the **event** but the attendee is compatible

The **event** may also be deemed to be bookable if the **event** contains a deep
link to a URL where the user can book the **event** independently, however
this is out of scope for this API

The above set of restrictions are at the level of the **event** and the data
contained within the content of the API returns.

On a **booking system** level, an **event** is 'bookable', mediated by a
specific **broker**, if that **broker** has machine readable permission to
access the relevant instance of the Booking API provided by the **booking**
system via an API key or similar token.

For the purposes of this specification, the **event** is only bookable if the
data describing the the **event** is published via a **booking system** which
is compliant with and supports the Open Active Booking API.


### Checking availability and offers for an event

To check the availability of an event a **broker** will issue a GET request to
the URI specified in the `id` of the Event.

The **booking system** MUST ensure that the data presented to the **broker** in
the `remainingAttendeeCapacity` property is up to date and includes a
combination of places already booked and places currently reserved by leases
from in-progress **orders**.

It is the responsibility of **brokers** to ensure that spaces within the event
are still available before proceeding with booking.

  "endDate": "2018-01-27T12:00:00Z",
  "duration": "PT1H",
  "location": {
    ...
  }
}

</pre>

The **broker** MUST assemble a set of all applicable **offers** for an **event**
from the information supplied by the **booking system**. An applicable **offer**
is an **offer** which is available for an **event** which is bookable and for
which the **customer** is eligible.

In the case of the **event** having no `subEvent` the set of all applicable
**offers** is simply the array of **offers** contained within the `offers`
property.

In the case of an **event** containing sub-events within the `subEvent` property
the set of all applicable offers should be compiled from the **offers** from the
sub-event selected by the customer, augmented with any additional different
offers contained in the parent super-event.

If the sub-event selected by the **customer** has no **offers** the set of all
applicable offers will be compiled from the **offers** contained withinin the
super-event.

The **broker** should then filter this set to provide a set of current **offers**
which apply to the **customer**. This specification provides no guidance as to
how the filtering should be performed.

The **broker** SHOULD however show all applicable **offers** to a customer,
including information on pricing restrictions, unless the **customer** has only
requested a subset in some form of preferences (e.g. only show adult classes
and offers).

The **customer** selects one of these **offers** and when all pre-conditions
have been met, the **broker** enters the **order** creation workflow on behalf
of the customer.


        </pre>


### Obtaining a lease on a space within an event

**orders** SHOULD contain a `orderLeaseDuration` property. This
property MUST contain an ISO 8601 formatted duration for the lease. The lease
duration may also be advertised somewhere else to make it clear in advance,
e.g. in docs/setup config, or as part of a `potentialAction` property.

(Note: In previous iterations of the Booking API specification, the lease was
a property of an event. This has now been depracated.)

The `orderLeaseDuration` property notifies the **broker** about the
length of time for which a space will be reserved by the **booking system**
whilst payment for the **event** is taken by the third-party payment system.

The default suggested lease duration is 15 minutes, but it is up to each
**booking plaftorm** to define and advertise their own lease duration.

This lease is NOT designed as a pause for a shopping cart system which is out
of scope for v1.0 of this specification.

The **broker** MUST ensure that it has obtained all of the relevant details
about a **customer** before getting to the point where it attempts to place an
**order**. The lease is not designed as a pause in the process whilst a
**customer** is registered by a **broker**.

The client may then present the updated availability and suitable offers to
the customer.

## Creating and updating orders

Booking systems MUST expose an orders endpoint, e.g. `/orders` to allow brokers
to initiate the booking workflow.

### Discovering the order endpoint

**Booking systems** MUST expose an orders endpoint, e.g. /orders to allow
**brokers** to initiate and enter the **booking** workflow.

To initiate the **booking workflow**, the **booking system** must include a
`potentialAction` field within each **bookable** **event**. The
`potentialAction` field MUST contain one or more objects of type ReserveAction.

These ReserveAction objects must contain a `target` field containing an
EntryPoint object.

The EntryPoint object MUST state the `url` of the orders endpoint, and SHOULD
contain the `encodingType` and the `httpMethod` which must be POST as a new
**order** object will be created on successful invocation.

An example is below:

<pre class="example" title="Example of a ReserveAction">

"potentialAction": [
        {
          "type": "ReserveAction",
          "name": "Book",
          "target": {
            "type": "EntryPoint",
            "url": "https://example.com/orders",
            "encodingType": "application/vnd.openactive.v0.5+json",
            "httpMethod": "POST"
          }
        }
      ]
</pre>


### Pre-conditions for creating an order

Before creating an **order** the **broker** MUST:

- have obtained **customer** information
- have determined that the **event** is bookable
- have identified the selected **offer**
- have prompted **customer** that they will enter a **payment** flow
(no pre-emptive leasing)
- have indicates that the **customer's** personal information is being submitted
to third-party (the **booking system** and the **seller**) and made the customer
aware of and assent to any legitimate privacy policy and terms and conditions
- have already obtained permission to use API


Before creating an **order** the **broker** SHOULD:

- have registered the **customer** (or have the **customer's** details to hand)
- have identified the **customer's** preferred payment options



### Creating a new order (`/orders`)

A POST request to the `/orders` endpoint of the **booking system** will result
in server creating an new **Order**. A time limited lease will be created for
the **events** referenced in the **Order**.

The `broker` property in the request body is to help the **booking platform** to
clarify who is making request and to help them in situations such as queries
to allow reconciliation of payments. It is not designed as any part of an
authentication which should be performed outside of the JSON body of the
request. No authentication tokens should be present within the `broker` property
of the submitted JSON.

The `broker` property should be a well formed schema:Organisation object.

In the situation where This allows a middleware is used to handle access control
for various **brokers**, independently of API key provisioning at the
**booking system** (which in some systems is a lengthly and time-consuming
process), the `broker` property should contain the details of the end-user
**broker** rather than the middleware.


        <pre class="example" title="Creating an order - request">

	}]
}
        </pre>

### Deleting an order (`/orders/{orderId}`)

A `DELETE` request to an **Order** URI will delete the order. Deletion may only
be used in the specific case for cancelling an **order** and the associated
lease on a space in an **event** if the **customer** no longer wishes to take
up the opportunity.

A `DELETE` request MUST NOT be used to cancel an existing completed **order**
as part of a refund/cancellation workflow. An appropriate approach for that is
defined elsewhere.

### Completing an order (`/orders/{orderId}`)

An **order** is completed by the **broker** submitting notification that the
**customer** has made a payment via a third-party payment gateway.

An **order** is not considered complete until payment has occurred.

**Brokers** MUST update the **booking system** to indicate that **payment** has
been taken.

Once the **booking system** is content with the payments, it then sets the
`orderStatus` property of the `Order` to https://schema.org/OrderDelivered and
returns a representation of the completed **order** with a 200 status code.

## Leases and the orderLeaseDuration property

If the lease expires during **payment**, the **broker** MAY delete the **order**
(if the **booking system** has not already done so, returning a response with a
410 status code).

The **broker** should then create a new **order** for the
**customer** in order to generate a new lease.

Before creating a new order, the **broker** MUST check the **event** and **offers** to ensure
that a space still exists within the **event** and that the **offer** selected
by the **customer** is still valid.

If no space exists or the **offer** is now invalid, the **customer**
should be refunded if payment has been taken.


## The state transitions during the order process

1. An **order** object is created by a **broker** invoking the orders endpoint
with a POST request containing details of the **broker** (represented as a
schema:Organisation), **customer** (represented as a schema:Person) and details
of the selected **event** and **offer** as components of a schema:OrderItem
object.
The **booking system** returns a representation of the **order** object to the
**broker** in a response with a 201 status and the URL for the object in the
`Location` header. The `orderStatus` of the **order** at this point in the flow
should be https://schema.org/OrderPaymentDue
2. Concurrently the **booking system** also creates a lease for a space in the
**event** for the **customer** for the duration specified in the
`orderLeaseDuration` property of the **event**.
3. The **broker** directs the customer into the flow of the third-party
**payment** provider.
4. If the **customer** successfully completes the payment within the duration
of the lease, the **broker** sends notification of the payment with a PATCH
request to the specific order end point (/orders/123 in the examples) with
details of the **payment** in the `paymentMethod` and `paymentMethodId`
properties. At this point the **order** is deemed to be completed. The
`orderStatus` property should be currently set to
`https://schema.org/OrderDelivered` and the `confirmationNumber`
property set to an appropriate unique value by the **booking system**. At this
point in the flow, the **order** is deemed to be complete.

If the lease expires before the payment is made, the **order** should either be
deleted by the **broker** or be deleted by the **booking system** at some point
after expiry. The `orderStatus` property should be set to
https://schema.org/OrderCancelled to indicate that the **order** cannot proceed
to completion.

## Events after order completion: confirmations and refunds

Both the **broker** and **booking system** may need to take further actions after
completing an order. This section describes some potential interactions.

### Supplying a confirmation to the customer

The **broker** SHOULD provide the **customer** with confirmation of a successful
payment having been made through the third-party system and that the **order**
has been completed successfully. The **broker** will have access to a completed
**order** which will contain a `confirmationCode` property.

The **booking system** may also provide the **customer** with a confirmation that
the space at the **event** has been booked on their behalf.

### Refunding a customer and cancelling an order

<div class="issue" title="Cancelling an order needs documenting" data-number="47">
</div>

## Customers

### Creation of customers on the booking system

In this current iteration of the Booking API specification, the programmatic
creation of **customers** on the **booking system** by the **broker** is
considered to be out of scope.

### Viewing a customer's previously placed orders

A server MUST provide endpoints to allow **brokers** to retrieve information
about previously placed **orders**. In future versions of the specification,
endpoints may be provided which permit a **broker** to see all **orders**
created by a **customer**. In this current implementation, if the **broker**
wishes to present a view of all **orders** for a **customer**, it should keep
an internal record.

### Deletion of personal data of the customer if the order is not completed

If an **order** is not completed, the **booking system** SHOULD delete all
personal information of the **customer** provided to it as part of the **order**
creation process.

# Future versions of this API

Version 0.5 of the API is a stepping stone towards the 1.0 specification of the
Booking API. It is not yet feature complete and there are some requirements
which are not satisfied by version 0.5.

Some of the patterns within version 0.5, for example the PATCHing of an order
resource to provide a payment and usng PATCH to change the status of an `orderItem` to
cancel an order provide the groundwork for known requirements such as multiple
order items (shopping carts), cancellation of individual order items and also
multipart payments.

Both `orderItems` and `payments` are modelled as collections to support
extension of the version 0.5 specification towards multipart orders and
payments without breaking changes in the Order model for subsequent versions.

The new models for Payment and for Error enhance the Open Active model
specification to make it more transactional when used as part of the Booking
API.

The currently known requirements not satisfied in version 0.5 are:

- multiple part orders
- supporting multiple payments
- customer creation
- managing of reservations
- support for member lookups

We have not yet decided what the priorities are, or whether all of these
requirements are in scope for version 1.0 and would encourage people to shape
future iterations of the specification by becoming involved in the communities
associated with Open Active and the open specification.
